##### Writing/Reading from a file part 1

1. Write a while loop with an input statement inside the loop. Define a (single) string that stores all of the inputs by appending the current input to any previous inputs. Exit the loop when the user enters q (or Q). After the loop exits write the output to a file.

2. Rewrite your loop to count how many lines the user inputs. Use the count to read in and print out the contents of the file â€“ the count will tell you how many readlines() you need.
