##### Writing/Reading from a file part 1

1. Write a while loop with an input statement inside the loop. Define a (single) string that stores all of the inputs by appending the current input to any previous inputs. Exit the loop when the user enters q (or Q). After the loop exits write the output to a file. Use f = open(...) to open the file

2. Rewrite your loop to count how many lines the user inputs. Use the count to read in and print out the contents of the file using readline(). Use the counter from part 1 to determine how many lines to read.
